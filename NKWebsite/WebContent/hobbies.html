		<div class="content">
			<p>My main hobby is building and flying FPV (First Person View) racing quadcopters. I spend most of my excess time and money building, repairing, flying and learning about these extremely athletic quadcopters. These quadcopters can fly faster than 100km/h and are extremely stable and controllable in the air. This complete control is achieved by the four independent motors working together to control all 3 axis with precision, and by sending a live video feed back to my FPV goggles on the ground I am able to see from the perspective of the quad. Miniquads are exhilarating to watch and fly but can only fly for around 2-5 minutes per battery. <a href="https://www.multigp.com/">MultiGP</a> is the most common racing league for FPV quadcopter hobbyists.</p>

		<div class="content">		
			<p>I’ve played tennis every summer since I was 8 years old in the <a href="https://tenacity.org/">Tenacity summer camp</a> at Newton park. This summer (2018) was the first summer I participated in Tenacity as a counselor instead of a camper. This spring was also my first season with the SHCS varsity tennis team, playing as first doubles.</p>
